# Requirements
Imagine that you are building a website for film enthusiasts to explore the top-rated movies of the year. By integrating with your own movie information API, your website should support the following use-cases:

- Discovery - users of your website can view the top 10 movies of the year at a glance
- Research - users can compare movie metadata, such as ratings, actors, etc. in order to select
a film to screen
- Booking - users are able to proceed to purchase tickets to the desired movie via a button (the
button’s implementation is not required, the button can redirect the user to or another 3rd party website)

From a functional and UX perspective, how the movies or their details interact and are displayed is entirely up to you. As long as the above requirements are met, feel free to focus on areas you’re most interested in.

Feel free to create your own backend and APIs to support the front end. Please make sure the code is properly covered with unit test cases and also easy to understand. Don't overdo. Try to build a code that you should be proud of. We don't want you to consume too much time of yours. We just need to check proof of concept. Whatever code you commit please make sure it is of good quality.

**It will be great if you can use ReactJs and NodeJs for the front-end and back-end services. Don't bother to use any database (if you do, it's a bonus). Feel free to deploy in Github pages or Heroku or any free deployment servers. Please share your Github link with us once you are done.**
